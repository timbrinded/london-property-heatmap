## Methodology Notes

1. **Primary sources**: School official websites, GDST network news
2. **Secondary sources**: Good Schools Guide, NappyValleyNet, WhichSchoolAdvisor
3. **Tolerance**: ±2% considered acceptable due to rounding and reporting variations
4. **Year verification**: Confirmed 2024 results specifically (not 2023 or 2025)

---

## Data Quality Observations

1. **GDST schools** generally have excellent documentation of results
2. **Some schools** only publish A*-B percentages, making A*-A verification difficult
3. **Prestigious schools** (Westminster, St Paul's, etc.) often don't publish specific percentages publicly
4. **Several schools** show significant discrepancies (>10%) suggesting data was estimated or outdated
